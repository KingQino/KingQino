### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Intelligent System Engineering research team at Queen Mary, under the guidance of [Dr. Jun Chen](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/jun.chen).
- ðŸŒ± My research is centered around designing meta-heuristic algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with businesses in the logistics and transportation sector. Together, we aim to develop solutions that can effectively reduce ecological footprints and operational costs within the industry.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to explore our website: [Intelligent Systems Engineering at QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/intelligentsystems/).
- ðŸ¤” I love outdoor activities, so feel free to invite me whenever you have plans.
